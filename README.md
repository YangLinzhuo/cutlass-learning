# cutlass-learning

This repository is for saving code about NVIDIA `cutlass` library.

Some code might not be highly-optimized yet.

## pycute

`pycute` folder is `Python` code for easily printing `cute` layout in cutlass.

The base code is copied from `cutlass/python/pycute` folder in [`cutlass` library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass). Only necessary code is implemented now for personal usage.

I mostly use `print_layout`, `print_latex` or `print_latex_tv` function to print thread-value mapping for visualization.
